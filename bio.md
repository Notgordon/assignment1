I'm eager to learn new concepts in this class. I enjoy reading, learning new concepts, playing video games, 
and hanging out with friends. I look forward to seeing how I can implement skills I learn in this 
further down the road in my career as a programmer and hopefully in my future career as a game developer or 
designer.
