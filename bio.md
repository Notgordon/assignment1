I'm eager to learn new concepts in this class. I enjoy reading, learning new concepts, playing video games, 
and hanging out with friends. I look forward to seeing how I can implement skills I learn in this 
further down the road in my career as a programmer and hopefully in my future career as a game developer or 
designer. 
<h1> Programming Background </h1>
I still consider myself a novice programmer. The most experience that I've had is here at OSU. I struggle
with concepts but I can understand them with enough time and patience. I've had prior experience in HTML,
CSS, and a bit of dabbling in php. I took the introductory web authoring class at OSU and I've had some 
experience in high school through a Dream Weaver and HTML class.
