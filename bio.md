I enjoy reading, learning new concepts, playing video games, 
and hanging out with friends. I look forward to seeing how I can implement skills I learn in this 
further down the road in my career as a programmer and hopefully in my future career as a game developer or 
designer. I'm considered to be affable by my friends and enjoy the company of others. I appreciate the input 
of others because I know for a fact I can't do everything on my own. Talking with others is a great way for me
to establish connections and grow from their experience. I'm glad to know that communication is playing
an imperative role in CS
<h1> Programming Background </h1>
I still consider myself a novice programmer. The most experience that I've had is here at OSU. I struggle
with concepts but I can understand them with enough time and patience. I've had prior experience in HTML,
CSS, and a bit of dabbling in php. I took the introductory web authoring class at OSU and I've had some 
experience in high school through a Dream Weaver and HTML class. So far I'm enjoying implementing github in
this assignment, this will definitely be a useful tool to use on my off time too. I've had some experience with
javascript and c# through Unity. Collaborating with others on a gaming project with Git may just be a solution
to making progress over breaks in the school year. I look forward to broadening my skill set this upcoming 
term.
