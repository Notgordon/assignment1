I'm eager to learn new concepts in this class. I enjoy reading, learning new concepts, playing video games, 
and hanging out with friends. I look forward to seeing how I can implement skills I learn in this 
further down the road in my career as a programmer and hopefully in my future career as a game developer or 
designer. I'm considered to be affable by my friends and enjoy the company of others. I appreciate the input 
of others because I know for a fact I can't do everything on my own. Talking with others is a great way for me
to establish connections and grow from their experience. I'm glad to know that communication is playing
an imperative role in CS
